# Supernova Neutrino Detection :telescope: :star:

## This work is part of my undergrad final project
Centuries ago, the chinese would record testemony of strange stars in the night sky. Those stars appeared once every few centuries, shining bright in the sky
being visible even at daytime. Then, after weeks or months, they would vanish. The ancient chinese described these stars as *guest stars*.

Today, we know these were not stars at all. Instead, they were watching the death of a star... a supernova! These supernovas throw imense amounts of neutrinos
into space, enabling us to detect them by their neutrino signal.

This repository is dedicated to the part of my final project that simulates a supernova detection at the Deep Underground Neutrino Detector (DUNE).

## Prerequisites

* It is highly recommended that the person who reads this code understands, at some basic level, the process of supernova detection by neutrino signals

* Some prior knowledge in python :snake: is assumed (I try to be as more didatic as possible)

## Organization

This repository contains 4 main files:


### Jupyter Notebook :notebook:

* Jupyter Notebook with the full code used for the simulations and adjustments for the final project

### CSV files

* A .csv file containing data from the emission of neutrinos from supernova simulations with Monte Carlo

* Another .csv file with data from simulations of DUNE's efficiency and the Neutrino-Argon cross-section by CC process

* A final .csv, not used in the final project that will be used in the future for a improvement in the results. That csv contains data from neutron mass distributions and will be used for better estimate of the total energy emitted by the supernova
