# Supernova Neutrino Detection :telescope: :star:

## This work is part of my undergraduation final project
Centuries ago, the chinese would record testemony of strange stars in the night sky. Those stars appeared once every few centuries, shining bright in the sky
being visible even at daytime. Then, after weeks or months, they would vanish. The ancient chinese described these stars as *guest stars*.

Today, we know these were not stars at all. Instead, they were watching the death of a star... a supernova! These supernovas throw imense amounts of neutrinos
into space, enabling us to detect them by their neutrino signal.

This repository is dedicated to the part of my final project that simulates an supernova detection at the Deep Underground Neutrino Detector (DUNE).

## Prerequisites

-It is highly recommended that the person who reads this code understands, at some basic level, the process of supernova detection by neutrino signals

-Some prior knowledge in python :snake: is assumed (I try to be more didatic as possible)

## Organization

... in construction
